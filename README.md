Expected to be used with most recent neovim + Lazy + Mason

## Configuration

Plugin specific configuration can be found in lua/plugins/{plugin_in_question}.

Keymap configuration can be found in lua/config/keymaps.lua.

Certain plugins may have keymap configurations in their file.

More direct vim behavior settings can be found in lua/config/options.lua.

Colorschemes can be configured by providing the name of a downloaded colorscheme as a string in lua/config/settings.lua. The colorscheme can be defined to be installed in lua/config/colorschemes.lua.
